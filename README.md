# GANs-For-synthatic-Medical-data-ECGS
This project uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic electrocardiogram (ECG) data from a dataset of 5000 ECGs obtained from PhysioNet. The generated data includes both normal and abnormal ECG patterns, providing a valuable resource for research and development of machine learning models
